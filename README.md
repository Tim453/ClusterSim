# ClusterSim

**ClusterSim** is a cycle-accurate simulator for modeling modern GPUs executing CUDA programs.
It is built on top of [GPGPU-Sim](https://github.com/gpgpu-sim/gpgpu-sim_distribution) and extends its functionality to support new hardware and programming features.

---

## New features compared to GPGPU-Sim 4.0

* Group cores into GPCs with `gpgpu_n_cores_per_gpc` parameter
* New Special registers: `%cluster_ctaid`, `%cluster_ctarank`, `%cluster_nctaid`, `%cluster_nctarank`...
* New Instructions:  `mapa`, `barrier.cluster`
* New directives: `.explicitcluster`, `.maxclusterrank`, `.reqnctapercluster`
* New API calls: `cudaLaunchKernelExC`, `cudaMallocManaged`,
* Simulationmodel for the SM to SM interconnect

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Dependencies

Install required packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential xutils-dev bison zlib1g-dev flex \
    libglu1-mesa-dev git cmake ninja-build clang clang-format
```

Make sure the CUDA toolkit is in your `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin
```

---

### üî® Build

The simulator builds as a shared library. CUDA applications linked against `cudart` (as a shared library) can be run on the simulator by adjusting the dynamic link loader path.

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j
```

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run

By default, ClusterSim uses the configuration file at
`configs/tested-cfgs/SM90_H100/gpgpusim.config`.

You can change this via the `GPUSIM_CONFIG` environment variable.

```bash
# If not already in rpath:
source enable_simulator.sh

# Verify CUDA program links to simulator‚Äôs libcudart
ldd build/bin/network

# Run a CUDA program
./build/bin/network

# Change GPU config
export GPUSIM_CONFIG=<PATH_TO_CONFIG>/gpgpusim.config
./build/bin/network
```
